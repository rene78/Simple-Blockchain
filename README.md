This page was created to help me understand the functionality of a blockchain. It is implemented as a chain of blocks, each block containing a hash of the previous block up to the genesis block of the chain. The peer-to-peer aspect and validation is not taken into account in this demo. SHA256 is used for hashing. The demo is based on the tutorial created by [Savjee.be](https://savjee.be/2017/07/Writing-tiny-blockchain-in-JavaScript/).
